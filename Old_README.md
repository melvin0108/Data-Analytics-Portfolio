# 📊 1 – HR Attrition Dashboard  

## 1️⃣ User Story
Mr. Ryan, the Head of HR, wanted a comprehensive and interactive dashboard to analyze the company’s employees. The goal was to answer key HR questions about:
✅ Employee demographics (race, education, age, gender)
✅ Workforce size, attrition rate, and hiring trends

# 📊 2 – Contoso Sales & Customer Service Dashboard  

## 1️⃣ 📖 User Story – Contoso Sales & Customer Service Dashboard
The CEO of the Contoso e-commerce business needs a single interactive dashboard to understand the company’s sales performance and customer service efficiency. This dashboard helps them track revenue trends, see which products and campaigns bring in the most sales, and check if KPIs are being met. It also shows how well the customer service team is performing, who the top revenue clients are, and which open cases need attention so the company can improve client retention and satisfaction.

They want to:

See overall sales performance – how many opportunities are open, won, or lost, and whether revenue targets are being achieved.

Identify which products, campaigns, and regions bring the most revenue so resources can be focused effectively.

Understand deal win/loss factors – which discounts, campaigns, or sales reps lead to higher success rates.

Know who the top revenue-generating clients are so they can reward loyal customers and strengthen relationships.

Monitor customer service KPIs like satisfaction, escalation rate, SLA compliance, and resolution time.

Get visibility on open and high-priority cases to make sure issues are resolved quickly to keep customers happy.

This dashboard lets executives filter by sales owner, manager, region, or product category and get both a high-level overview and detailed insights to make better business decisions.

The dashboard answers key business questions for the CEO:  
✅ How are sales performing over time?  
✅ Which products and campaigns generate the most revenue?  
✅ Are revenue KPIs being met by region, sales owner, and category?  
✅ Which companies bring the most revenue (for client appreciation initiatives)?  
✅ How is the customer service team performing in handling cases and inquiries?  
Before you click on the link to my dashboard, I want to clarify this to you:
There are 2 charts in this report that cannot be published on the web version of Power BI, so I replaced them with static screenshots on the published link.

📥 For the best experience, I highly recommend downloading the .pbix file to explore the dashboard fully and interact with all visuals.
